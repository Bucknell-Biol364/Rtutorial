You will first need to hit the green "Clone or download" button and select the "Download ZIP" option. This will download all of the files associated with this tutorial into a zip folder in your computer's Downloads folder. It should be called something like Rtutorial-master. You can keep this folder in your Downloads folder or move it to your Documents folder. Just be sure to remember where this folder is located.

In this folder you should either open the Rtutorial.R (for neur tutorial) or Rtutorial_anbe.R (for anbe) file to begin. From there you will follow step by step instructions for how to analyze and visualize data, and have the opportunitity to practice running some code.

Good luck!
